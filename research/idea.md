## How you play the game

* Player 1 selects a 2 word topic, eg: "kitten cuteness", and posts an image.
* Player 2 chooses a "better" image that suits the topic, (from the returned 9 images results via google images), adding 1 new word that can be associated with their image, (from a list of 5 suggestions), eg: "bowlerhat"
* Player 1 responds, with a "better" image, that is relevant to the topics, adding a word and so on...
* When you reach 3 images (or perhaps 5?) per user, the game is over, and people can vote on which player did best.

Note: alternative games with more features can be done, but it seems better to limit it to a simpler playing style initially - perhaps a "pro" version will allow posting your own images, your own keywords (tags), and unlock the NSFW filter, and so on...

## How you score the game

* On the front-page of the app there will be games waiting to be scored, users that did not participate in the game can score - ideally you can invite a 3rd person to score, that is known to both parties, as the moves might well have personal relevance, and would allow a "private" game to take place.

## Length of a game

Some games will be over in seconds, others can take longer - this is a turn based game, and you might not want to finish quickly, especially if you're simply using it to compare holiday snaps with a friend, or something like that - though this kind of game would require more than just the basic functionality, eg: configurable game length, etc...

## Problems

* You cannot win without adjudicators - it would be good if we could find a way to score the battle automatically - though this is also part of the charm of the game - it is open to interpretation.
