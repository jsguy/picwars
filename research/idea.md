Declare war on your friends via Facebook, SMS, Twitter, etc...! Conquer the world.


## How you play the game

* Players start with 5 tags (words) each. These are semi-related tags, so they can be combined * in a meaningful way.
* Player 1 starts by posting a tag and an image.
* Each player can optionally post a 70char message for each photo.
* Once the game is complete, observers can also make comments.

Note: We use a similar layout as an SMS application would do, so it will be instantly familiar to the users.

Note2: Later on, alternative games with more features can be done, but initially I'd like to limit it to a simpler playing style initially - perhaps a "pro" version will allow posting your own images, your own keywords (tags), and unlock the NSFW filter, and so on...

## How you score the game

* On the front-page of the app there will be games waiting to be scored, users that did not participate in the game can score - ideally you can invite a 3rd person to score, that is known to both parties, as the moves might well have personal relevance, and would allow a "private" game to take place. You can have multiple observers, and invitations can be extended at any time, even after the game has fininshed.

## Length of a game

Some games will be over in minutes, others can take longer - this is a turn based game, and you might not want to finish quickly, especially if you're simply using it to compare holiday snaps with a friend, or something like that - though this kind of game would require more than just the basic functionality, eg: configurable game length, etc...

## Problems

* You cannot win without adjudicators - it would be good if we could find a way to score the battle automatically - though this is also part of the charm of the game - it is open to interpretation.
